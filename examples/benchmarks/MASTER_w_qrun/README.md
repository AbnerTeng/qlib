You can directly use the bash script to run the codes (you can set the `universe` and `only_backtest` flag in `run.sh`), this `main.py` will test the model with 10 random seeds:
```
bash run.sh
```
or you can just directly use `qrun` tp run the codes:
```
qrun workflow_config_master_Alpha158.yaml
```
